# COVID-19 Vaccine Progress Visualization Project

Welcome to the COVID-19 Vaccine Progress Visualization Project! This project aims to provide insightful visualizations about the global vaccine rollout, vaccine usage across countries, and the trends in infections since the vaccination campaign began.

This repository contains the data and visualizations for two dashboards:

## Dashboard 1: Which Vaccines Are Used by Which Countries?

This dashboard provides an overview of the various COVID-19 vaccines being used in different countries. It presents a world map with each country color-coded based on the primary vaccine being administered. You can also view the details of the vaccines used in each country, such as the vaccine name, manufacturer, and the total number of doses administered.

### Key features:

- Interactive world map displaying the primary vaccines used in each country
- Vaccine distribution statistics for each country

## Dashboard 2: What is the trend of infections since the global vaccination campaign began?

This dashboard illustrates the trends in COVID-19 infections since the beginning of the global vaccination campaign. It includes line charts to display the trends in monthly new cases and the cumulative number of cases. Users can compare the trends for various countries or regions and analyze the impact of vaccination efforts on the infection rates.

### Key features:

- Line charts showing trends in monthly new cases and cumulative cases
- Compare trends for different countries or regions
- Analyze the impact of vaccination efforts on infection rates
